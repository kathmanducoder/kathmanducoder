### Hi there :wave:

I am a software engineer with 10+ years of professional dev experience building a wide range of software from complex Linux-based networking systems to backend, APIs and frontend of microservices-based web apps. I have a strong understanding of computer networks from data link layer to application layer and the know-hows in terms of tools and utilities to setup environments, or debug and analyze networking or system issues.
