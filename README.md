### Hi there :wave:

I am a software engineer with 10+ years of professional dev experience building a wide range of software from complex Linux-based networking systems to backend, APIs and frontend of microservices-based web apps. I have a strong understanding of computer networks - from Ethernet to application layer protocols.
